# SARCASM-DETECTION
This project aims to develop a sarcasm detection system that can classify whether a given news headline is sarcastic or not. Using deep learning techniques, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, the model processes textual data and predicts sarcasm with high accuracy.
